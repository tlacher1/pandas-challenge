# Pandas Challenge 

## Instructions
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

District Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Include the following:

* Total number of unique schools

* Total students

* Total budget

* Average math score

* Average reading score

* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary
Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

Include the following:

* School name

* School type

* Total students

* Total school budget

* Per student budget

* Average math score

* Average reading score

* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)

* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)

* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

## Conclusions
The city’s school district wanted to analyze the district-wide standardized test results to find any trends that can be used for school improvement and budgeting purposes. The analysis took metric snapshots of each school’s math and reading results as well as the metrics for the district as a whole. There was also a measurement of whether per student spending improved the overall testing outcome. The data was also run to compare small, medium, and large schools as well as any differences between district and charter schools.

There were two interesting conclusions that came out of the analysis.

1. Charter schools performed considerably higher than district schools.

2. Schools that spent less per student performed better than schools that spent more per student.

These results would require further analysis. Is the reason for the charter school’s high performance based on the selection of students into their programs? Charter schools tend to also be smaller with a lower teacher to student ratio whereas the larger schools must accept all students and have higher teacher to student ratios.
